# {{.RFC822Timestamp}} expands to a timestamp in RFC822 format
# {{.ISO8601Timestamp}} expands to a timestamp in ISO8601 format
# {{.UnixTimestamp}} expands to a unix epoch timestamp to nanosecond precision

# Example -
# prepend_value = "[app_name]- "
# prepend_value = "[app_name] {{.RFC822Timestamp}}- "

# Kafka output example
# [target]
# name = "kafka"

# topic = "testtopic"
# clientID = "funnel"
# You need not set the below settings. They will be set to kafka default values if not specified

# Redis output example
# [target]
# name = "redis"
# host = "localhost:6379"
# password = "" # If no password is set, keep it blank
# channel = "test" # Specify the channel to publish to

# ElasticSearch output example
# P.S. Since ES takes json objects, log lines have to be in json.
# eg lines-
# {"User": "bacon", "Message": "i will be back !"}
# {"User": "tea", "Message": "Open the bifrost !"}
# [target]
# name = "elasticsearch"
# nodes = ["http://host1:port", "http://host2:port"]
# index = "testindex"
# type = "testtype"
# You can set the username and password to blank if you are not using basic auth
# username = "testuser"
# password = "testpass"

# InfluxDB output example
# P.S. InfluxDB has the concept of tags and fields. Log lines have to be in this format -
# {"tags": {"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "other_value1"}, "fields": {"field1": 10, "field2": 20}}
# {"tags": {"tag1": "value2", "tag2": "other_value2"}, "fields": {"field1": 11, "field2": 21}}
# [target]
# name = "influxdb"
# host = "http://localhost:8086" # or "localhost:8089" in case of udp
# db = "testdb" # only valid for http. For udp, database if taken from influxDB config
# protocol = "http" # options are http, udp
# metric = "testmetric"
# username = "testuser"
# password = "testpass"
# time_precision = "s" # options are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"

# AWS S3 output example
# P.S. Files in s3 are named with the current timestamp
# [target]
# name = "s3"
# bucket = "bucket-name"
# region = "us-west-2"

# NATS output example
# [target]
# You can omit the user and password field if you don't have authentication set up
# name = "nats"
# host = "localhost"
# port = "4222"
# subject = "testsub"
# user = "testuser"
